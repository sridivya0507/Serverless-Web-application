**Web-Based Employee Information Portal**

This is a **serverless web application** built using **AWS** services to capture and display employee details (ID, name, age). The front end is designed with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, while the backend leverages **Lambda functions** integrated with **API Gateway** and **DynamoDB**.

### ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

* **Amazon S3** â€“ Hosts static website files (HTML, CSS, JS)
* **Amazon CloudFront** â€“ Delivers web content globally with low latency
* **AWS Lambda** â€“ Executes backend logic (insert/retrieve employee data)
* **Amazon API Gateway** â€“ Connects frontend to Lambda
* **Amazon DynamoDB** â€“ Stores employee records securely
* **AWS IAM** â€“ Manages secure service-to-service permissions

### ðŸ’¡ Features

* Add and view employee information through a clean, responsive UI
* Serverless architecture â€” no infrastructure management required
* Secure and scalable data handling via DynamoDB
* Global content delivery using CloudFront
* Seamless integration across all AWS components

### ðŸ“‚ How It Works

1. **Frontend**: Static site hosted on S3, served globally via CloudFront.
2. **User Interaction**: Form input sends GET/POST requests through API Gateway.
3. **Lambda Functions**: Handle logic to insert or fetch employee data.
4. **Database**: DynamoDB stores and returns structured employee information.

### ðŸ“¸ Sample UI

The portal includes form fields for entering employee details and a dynamic table to display all records.

### ðŸš€ Benefits

* Scalable, fast, and cost-efficient serverless setup
* Real-time updates with clean separation of concerns
* Secure data flow with fine-grained IAM roles
