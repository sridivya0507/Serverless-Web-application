Technologies: AWS (S3, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, CloudFront, IAM), HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

A serverless web application built with AWS. This portal captures and displays employee information (ID, name, age) through a responsive UI and a structured data table. Static content is hosted on Amazon S3 with global delivery via CloudFront. Backend logic is handled by AWS Lambda and API Gateway, with employee records securely stored in DynamoDB. IAM roles ensure proper access control between services. This project highlights serverless architecture, cloud integration, and front-end development.
